Project Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict fish weight based on its physical characteristics. The model is deployed as a Flask web application, where users can input fish attributes and receive predictions.

Dataset
Dataset: Fish Market Dataset
Features:

Species (Fish type - categorical)
Length1, Length2, Length3 (Different length measurements in cm)
Height (Vertical height in cm)
Width (Diagonal width in cm)
Weight (Target variable - in grams)
